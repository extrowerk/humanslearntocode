#you can access the characters one at a time with the bracket operator
#fruit = banana
#letter = fruit[1] which means (0 is b) (1 is a) (2 is n) and so on
#len is a built-in function that returns the number of characters in a string
###in this case len(fruit) is 6 because fruit is banana which has 6 letters
fruit="banana"
index = 0
while index < len(fruit):
    x_letter = fruit[index]
    print(x_letter)
    index = index + 1
####same thing using a for statement
fruit="kiwi"
for x_letter in fruit:
    print(x_letter)

##Looping and counting
word="bananatasteslikeananas"
count=0
for letter in word:
    if letter=="a":
        count= count+1
print("The number of times the letter a shows up is:",count,"times")
####slicing strings
###we can look at any continous section of a string using a colon operator (:)
s="Elon Musk"
print(s[0:4])
print(s[5:6])
print(s[0:20])
print(s[:2])
print(s[2:])
print(s[:])
